<h1>About the DAN Conservation Lab</h1>

<p><strong>Dan Liang</strong> is an Associate Professor in the School of Ecology at Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China. Trained as an animal ecologist and conservation scientist, he has broad interests in ecology, evolution, and biodiversity conservation. Before joining Sun Yat-sen University, Dan was an Associate Research Scholar at the Princeton School of International and Public Affairs, Princeton University. He received his PhD in Zoology from Sun Yat-sen University (2018) in Guangzhou, and earned his master’s degree in Zoology (2015) and bachelor’s degree in Wildlife and Nature Reserve Management (2012) from Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China.</p>

<p>The members of the DAN (Diversity And Nature) Conservation Lab combine fieldwork, modeling, and data mining to understand how human-induced disturbances affect biodiversity and to identify solutions for more effective conservation. In recent years, we have focused primarily on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Impacts of human disturbance on biodiversity</li>
<li>Ecology and conservation of migratory species</li>
<li>Biodiversity and conservation in montane ecosystems</li>
<li>Human dimensions of biodiversity conservation</li>
</ol>

<p>The DAN Conservation Lab is a young and growing group. We welcome Master’s and PhD students with a strong interest in animal ecology and conservation science to join us. Undergraduates at SYSU are also encouraged to collaborate with the lab on senior dissertations. We currently have two open postdoctoral positions (see details <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0-hDmT4Yc1Dnd047jJ9JMQ" target="_blank">here</a>). Highly motivated candidates with a strong background in animal ecology and conservation science are also encouraged to reach out to discuss other potential postdoctoral projects.</p>
